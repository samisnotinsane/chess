## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- make (for using Makefile)

### Installation and Setup

This project uses a Makefile to simplify the setup and management process.
Here are the available make commands:

- `make`: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
- `make venv`: Create a virtual environment
- `make install`: Install dependencies in the virtual environment
- `make test`: Run tests
- `make clean`: Remove the virtual environment and cache files
- `make help`: Show the help message with available commands

To get started, simply run `make`.
This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use: `make test`.

This command will ensure all dependencies are installed and then run the test suite.
